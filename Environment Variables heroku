1. heroku config

2. set new variable

   heroku config:set MVAAYOO_USERNAME=chet@gmail.com

you can use MVAAYOO_USERNAME now.

similarly set for other keys too.

Example. config/initializers/mvaayoo.rb

MVAAYOO_USER = ENV['MVAAYOO_USERNAME']
MVAAYOO_PASSWORD = ENV['MVAAYOO_PASSWORD']
SENDER_ID = ENV['MVAAYOO_SENDER_ID']
